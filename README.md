# project1-For-Black-Women
I wanted to make a positive blog dedicated to black women because there's not too many blogs that caters to black women. 
It's a blog where women of color can talk about the positivity of being a black woman and uplifting one another. For my project, I used AJAX, API, jQuery, underscore, MongoDB, Authentication, Templating and RESTful routing.
